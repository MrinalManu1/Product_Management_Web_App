## ✨ Features

- **🔒 Secure User Authentication:** Register, login, and logout with JWT and HTTP-only cookies.
- **👥 Role-Based Access:** Admins can add, edit, and delete products; customers can browse products.
- **📦 Product Management:** View, add, edit, and delete products.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on all devices.
- **🛡️ Security:** Password salting and hashing with bcryptjs.

Bot Detection:

Implements basic client-side checks (such as analyzing user agent, browser attributes, and interaction patterns) to identify potential bot activity.

Server-side monitoring and log analysis help detect and mitigate automated traffic that bypasses client-side protections.

Rate Limiting:

Enforces request limits per user/IP to protect against credential stuffing, scraping, and DDoS attacks.

Exceeding the rate limit results in an HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) response, effectively blocking excessive or suspicious activity
